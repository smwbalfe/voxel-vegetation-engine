# Voxel Vegetation Engine

The Voxel Vegetation Engine is a cutting-edge, open-source project designed to simulate and render dynamic vegetation environments in a voxel-based world. Leveraging modern graphics programming techniques and procedural content generation, this engine offers a unique platform for developers and researchers interested in exploring the intersection of computer graphics, ecology, and procedural generation.

## How It Works

### Engine Architecture

The engine is structured around a core rendering loop that integrates voxel terrain generation, dynamic vegetation simulation, and user interaction through an intuitive GUI. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

- **Voxel Terrain Generation**: At the heart of the engine is a voxel-based terrain system, capable of generating complex landscapes. This system uses a combination of noise functions and procedural rules to create varied terrain features.

- **Dynamic Vegetation Simulation**: On top of the terrain, the engine simulates the growth and interaction of various plant species using a combination of Lindenmayer Systems (L-systems) for procedural plant generation and custom algorithms for simulating plant life cycles and interactions.

- **Rendering Pipeline**: The engine employs a modern OpenGL rendering pipeline, utilizing shaders for efficient rendering of voxel terrain and vegetation. This includes support for advanced lighting, shadows, and post-processing effects to enhance the visual quality of the simulated environment.

- **GUI and Interaction**: An integrated GUI, built using the Dear ImGui library, allows users to interactively modify simulation parameters, observe real-time changes, and experiment with different procedural generation settings.

### Core Technologies

- **C++**: The primary programming language used for developing the engine, chosen for its performance and system-level control.
- **OpenGL**: Utilized for rendering, OpenGL offers the necessary flexibility and efficiency for real-time 3D graphics.
- **GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)**: Shaders written in GLSL are used for terrain and vegetation rendering, enabling complex visual effects.
- **Dear ImGui**: An immediate mode GUI library used for creating developer and user interfaces within the application.
- **Glad**: An OpenGL Loading Library is used to manage OpenGL function pointers, ensuring compatibility across different platforms.
- **Octree Implementation**: Used for efficient spatial partitioning, which is crucial for rendering and simulation in voxel-based environments.

## Getting Started
